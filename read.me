Create virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Test Dataset Generation:
python src/data_generation.py

Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run src/app.py

Run the API:
python src/api.py
The API starts at http://localhost:8000.
Youâ€™ll see logs indicating the server is running and model files are loaded.
Testing with Postman
Open Postman: Download and install Postman if not already installed (Postman website).
Test Health Check:
Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:8000/health
Send Request
Expected Response (Status: 200 OK):
json

{
  "status": "healthy"
}
Test Prediction Endpoint:
Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:8000/predict
Headers: Set Content-Type: application/json
Body: Raw JSON, e.g.:
json

{
  "food_name": "Injera"
}
Send Request
Expected Response (Status: 200 OK):
json

{
  "food_name": "Injera",
  "glucose_content_g_per_100g": 33.2,
  "diabetic_recommendation": {
    "recommendation": "Not Recommended",
    "details": "High glucose content, may cause blood sugar spikes."
  }
}
Test Another Food (e.g., "Tibs"):
json

{
  "food_name": "Tibs"
}
Expected Response:
json

{
  "food_name": "Tibs",
  "glucose_content_g_per_100g": 0.5,
  "diabetic_recommendation": {
    "recommendation": "Recommended",
    "details": "Low glucose content, safe for diabetic patients."
  }
}
Test Error Case:
Send an empty food name:
json

{
  "food_name": ""
}
Expected Response (Status: 500 Internal Server Error):
json

{
  "detail": "Error predicting glucose content: Food name cannot be empty."
}
Example Postman Workflow
Collection: Create a Postman collection named "Food Glucose API".
Requests:
"Health Check": GET http://localhost:8000/health
"Predict Injera": POST http://localhost:8000/predict with {"food_name": "Injera"}
"Predict Tibs": POST http://localhost:8000/predict with {"food_name": "Tibs"}
Run: Send each request and verify the responses match the expected JSON.
